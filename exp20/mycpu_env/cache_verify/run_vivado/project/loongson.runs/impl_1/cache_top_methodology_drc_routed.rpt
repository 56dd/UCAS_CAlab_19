2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cache/next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cache/next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cache/next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cache/next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cache/next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cache/next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cache/next_state_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cache/next_state_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cache/next_state_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cache/next_state_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cache/writebuf_nstate_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cache/writebuf_nstate_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cache/writebuf_nstate_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cache/writebuf_nstate_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk] (Source: D:/aaa/UCAS_CAlab_19/exp20/mycpu_env/cache_verify/run_vivado/constraints/cache_top.xdc (Line: 5))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: d:/aaa/UCAS_CAlab_19/exp20/mycpu_env/cache_verify/rtl/xilinx_ip/clk_pll.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk] (Source: D:/aaa/UCAS_CAlab_19/exp20/mycpu_env/cache_verify/run_vivado/constraints/cache_top.xdc (Line: 5))
